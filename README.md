# Week 3 - Day 1: DOM Manipulation + Event Listeners

## ðŸ§  Real-World Scenario
You're creating an interactive to-do or greeting app. Start with a button that updates a DOM element based on user input.

## ðŸŽ¯ Assignment
Create an HTML page that includes:
1. **Three buttons** â€“ each shows a different message when clicked
2. **An input text box** â€“ display a real-time character count as the user types
3. **A form** â€“ on submit, show a thank you alert
4. Use `addEventListener` or `onclick` to bind events
5. Use DOM selectors to target elements

> ðŸ’¡ Make sure each button displays a unique message in the output area when clicked.
> ðŸ’¡ The character counter should update instantly as the user types.
> ðŸ’¡ The form should show a thank you alert when submitted.

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Scoring
This assignment includes 5 test files. Each test is worth 20 points. Total = 100 points.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips & Common Mistakes
- Use `window.onload` or `defer` your script to ensure DOM is loaded
- Don't use parentheses in function references for event listeners (e.g., `btn.addEventListener('click', myFunc)`)
- Double-check your selectors (ID, class, tag)

## ðŸš€ Steps
1. Open `index.html` and add the required elements.
2. Follow comments inside the file.
3. Push to your GitHub repo. GitHub Actions will grade it!
